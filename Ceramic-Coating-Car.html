But despite your efforts maintaining and washing, the scratches, chips, and stains start to spread across your car's exterior and the paint begins to dull &amp; fade from the sun, which spurns many consumers to find ways of providing UV protection.</p><p>Contaminants Damage Car's Surface Constantly</p><p>Anything and everything is constantly attacking your car's surface. Mud, dust, dirty rain, water spots, unsightly brake dust, grime start sticking to your car almost immediately after cleaning it. And let's face it, having to wash your car is boring, monotonous and time-consuming. Snow, ice, salted roads, tree gum, bird shit doesn't help either.</p><p>Problems with Using Automatic Car Washes</p><p>Automatic car washes scratch and mars your paint, while the chemicals used are terrible for the surface. Not to mention daily life scratches from kids, shopping carts, bikes, and scooters.</p><p>Why Not Wax?<br />Wax adds a good level of shine and gloss, and a small amount of protection, but lasts a few months at best. But it certainly doesn't act as a quality glass coating product.</p>                    </section>                    <section>                        <h3></h3>											                    </footer>                </article>                           </div> <!-- #main -->        </div> <!-- #main-container -->                <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>        <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/vendor/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"><\/script>')</script>        <script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/plugins.js"></script>        <script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/mycss/js/main.js"></script>    </body></html><br><br><p><a href="https://web33a.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Ceramic-Car-Coating.html">ceramic coating</a><br> <a href="https://web33a.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Ceramic-Car-Coating.html">ceramic coating near me</a><br> <a href="https://web33a.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Ceramic-Car-Coating.html">ceramic car coating</a><br> <a href="https://web33a.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Ceramic-Car-Coating.html">ceramic coating car</a><br> <a href="https://web33a.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Ceramic-Car-Coating.html">ceramic coating for cars</a><br> <a href="https://web33a.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/Ceramic-Car-Coating.html">best ceramic coating</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
