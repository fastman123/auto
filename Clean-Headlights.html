Use a gentle stream of warm to avoid scratching the vehicle.</p><p>Step 3: Clean the wheels and tires first.</p><p>Use a spray-on, wipe-off cleaner, and let it sit for a bit. After hosing off the cleaner, scrub the tires in a circular motion to remove the rest of the dirt and grime. Clean the tighter areas with a sudsy wheel sponge, and use a smaller scrub brush to clean inside the wheels, if necessary. Always rinse out the wheel wash bucket thoroughly before using it for the regular wash.</p>                    </header>                     <section>                        <h2>How To Clean Foggy Headlights More Information</h2>												<p>Step 4: Wash using the two-bucket system.</p><p>One bucket is filled with car shampoo, and the other bucket is filled with clean water for rinsing out the microfiber cleaning mitt.
